I am an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Zoology and Physiology and the Sensory Biology Center at the University of Wyoming.  
My research focuses on the **neural control of metabolism**, with particular interest in **gut–brain communication and serotonin (5-HT) signaling** that regulate appetite and energy balance.  

During my postdoctoral training at the **University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center**, I made a series of discoveries that advanced our understanding of how the brain regulates energy balance and how therapeutic drugs can inadvertently alter these pathways.  
I demonstrated that the antipsychotic drugs **risperidone** and **olanzapine** act directly on **hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R)** to drive weight gain (*Journal of Experimental Medicine*, 2021). I further identified an **unexpected appetite-suppressing effect** of antimigraine **triptans**, mediated by **serotonin 1B receptors (Htr1b)**, and revealed that **Htr1b expression in NPY/AgRP neurons** underlies their hypophagic effects through a defined **Htr1b^AgRP → PVH circuit** (*Journal of Experimental Medicine*, 2022). In addition, I developed a **sample enrichment method using ConA-conjugated magnetic beads** to enhance the quality of **single-nucleus sequencing**, overcoming prior technical limitations (*STAR Protocols*, 2023).  

My long-term goal is to establish a research program that identifies **novel druggable targets in circumventricular organ neurons** and leverages these discoveries to develop new therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome.  

Selected publications and further details can be found on my [Publications](/publications/) page.
