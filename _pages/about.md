Our lab investigates how the brain senses and responds to peripheral metabolic signals to maintain energy balance. We are particularly interested in the **gutâ€“brain communication axis**, focusing on how serotonin (5-HT) and its receptors (e.g., Htr1b) in hypothalamic neurons influence feeding behavior, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation.
