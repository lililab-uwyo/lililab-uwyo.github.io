I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Zoology and Physiology and the Sensory Biology Center at the University of Wyoming.  
My research focuses on the **neural control of metabolism**, with particular interest in **gut–brain communication and serotonin (5-HT) signaling** that regulate appetite and energy balance. My long-term goal is to establish a research program that identifies novel druggable targets in circumventricular organ neurons and leverages these discoveries to develop new therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome.  

Selected publications and further details can be found on my [Publications](/publications/) page.
